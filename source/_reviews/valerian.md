You might not think that a movie inspired by a french comic book from 1967 would impact the massive filmindustry that exists this current day. In my eyes Valerian and the City of a Thousend Planents did excactly that. Watching the first teaser trailer of this movie on Nov 10, 2016 Luc Besson had me waiting for a while, as the release of the movie was a little less than a year later (21 July 2017). 

My first thougts watching this trailer
